# No-DB-Music-App
Music app without a database. I made this for my friend red. Fully compatible with repl.it.
## Cool, how do I install?
Change the name in the templates folder to your site name. Move the script into the folder you want your installation in.
## How do I add music?
Because this was just slapped together with the limited PHP knowledge I have, adding music is tedious.
For this exact reason I have provided a template file. It's recommended you get the images/audio from an external source, for storage reasons and so you dont have to deal with the clusterfuck that is the music folder.
**For this exact reason I would like contributors.**
## How to contribute?
Add however many files you want. If your contribution is especially helpful I'll give you write access. TIA if you can contribute. :)
